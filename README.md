# Transparent Charging Station

http://the-incredible-machine.com/chargingstation.html

> With the growing influence that hidden algorithms have over our daily lives, Alliander and Elaad predict the need for transparency in electric charging. Through a process of ideation sessions and multiple iterations of prototyping, we designed a new visual language that makes the charging algorithm transparent to the end-user. Based on this language we've designed and constructed a demonstration model of such a charging station, allowing users to experience first hand how electric charging might be done in the future.

The application running on the charging station prototype is a Node Electron app. Communicating with Arduino's to listen to the RFID scanners and control the LED's.
