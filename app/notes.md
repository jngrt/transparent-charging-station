rules


- every line, we check the priority and the stress level. 
- priority is given by the card
- stress is:
	- change to get charge in the future
	- but every charger has a chance.
	- so how do we do this....

- behavior
	- if you claim, and you have more priority, you push others to the future
	- if you claim, and have less priority, you only get minor shares.
	...

	- 

	- Each line
		- check who are still claiming
			- claims with unmet deadlines
			- claims with unmet requests
		- define stress for each claimers in the future
			- find total available charge until deadline, for each claimer
